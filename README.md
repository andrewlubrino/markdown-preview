# Markdown Previewer
Type some markdown on the left panel, see a preview of the rendered markdown on the right. Expand or minimize a panel by clicking the buttons in
the top right of each panel. This app was built with React and makes use of the [Marked JS library](https://marked.js.org/). The markdown previewer can be
found [here](https://andrewlubrino.github.io/markdown-preview/).
